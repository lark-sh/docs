Point your Firebase C++ SDK at Lark by passing your Lark URL to `Database::GetInstance()`. Everything else — listeners, writes, queries — works without changes.

## Setup

Add the Firebase C++ SDK to your project. Follow the [Firebase C++ setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup) for your platform (Android NDK, iOS, or desktop).

Make sure the Realtime Database library is linked:
- **Android**: `firebase_database` in your `CMakeLists.txt`
- **iOS**: `firebase.framework` and `firebase_database.framework`
- **Desktop**: `firebase_database` library

## Connect to Lark

Pass your Lark URL when getting the database instance:

```cpp
#include "firebase/app.h"
#include "firebase/database.h"

firebase::App* app = firebase::App::Create();

// Change this from https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com
firebase::database::Database* database =
    firebase::database::Database::GetInstance(
        app, "https://your-lark-project-id.larkdb.net");

firebase::database::DatabaseReference ref =
    database->GetReference("players/alice");
```

If your `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) already has the database URL, you can update it there instead and use `Database::GetInstance(app)` without a URL argument.

## Project settings

Before connecting, make sure your Lark project is configured correctly:

1. **Allow Legacy Firebase** must be enabled in your Lark project settings. This turns on the Firebase wire protocol.
2. If your Firebase app stores many independent data silos under path prefixes (game rooms, workspaces, etc.), see [Database routing](/firebase/database-routing) for options on splitting them into separate Lark databases.
