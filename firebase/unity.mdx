Point your Firebase Unity SDK at Lark by passing your Lark URL to `FirebaseDatabase.GetInstance()`. Everything else — listeners, writes, transactions — works without changes.

## Setup

Add the Firebase Realtime Database package to your Unity project:

1. Download the [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
2. Import `FirebaseDatabase.unitypackage` via **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package**
3. Add your `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to the project

## Connect to Lark

Pass your Lark URL when getting the database instance:

```csharp
using Firebase.Database;

// Change this from https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com
FirebaseDatabase database =
    FirebaseDatabase.GetInstance("https://your-lark-project-id.larkdb.net");

DatabaseReference myRef = database.GetReference("players/alice");
```

If your config file already has the database URL, you can update it there instead and use `FirebaseDatabase.DefaultInstance` directly.

## Project settings

Before connecting, make sure your Lark project is configured correctly:

1. **Allow Legacy Firebase** must be enabled in your Lark project settings. This turns on the Firebase wire protocol.
2. If your Firebase app stores many independent data silos under path prefixes (game rooms, workspaces, etc.), see [Database routing](/firebase/database-routing) for options on splitting them into separate Lark databases.
