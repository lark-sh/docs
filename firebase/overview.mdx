Lark is wire-compatible with Firebase Realtime Database. If you have an existing Firebase RTDB app, you can point it at Lark with minimal changes.

## What this means

The official Firebase SDKs can connect to Lark instead of Firebase. Your existing code — reads, writes, subscriptions, queries, transactions — works as-is. You don't need to rewrite anything.

Lark implements the same wire protocol that Firebase RTDB uses. When the Firebase SDK opens a WebSocket connection, it doesn't know (or care) that it's talking to Lark instead of Google's servers. The messages are identical.

The [REST API](/rest-api/overview) is also fully compatible — if your backend hits Firebase's `/.json` endpoints, change the hostname and it works with Lark.

<Tip>Lark passes 100% of Firebase's 800+ JS SDK test suite. Every operation, every edge case, every event type.</Tip>

## Enabling Firebase compatibility

To use Firebase SDKs with Lark, toggle **Allow Legacy Firebase** in your project's settings in the Lark dashboard. This enables the Firebase wire protocol on your project's endpoint.

## What you get

Everything Firebase RTDB offers, plus:

- **Performance** — Sub-50ms p99 latency.
- **New features** — Volatile paths, shared view optimization, and more.

## What's different

Not much. Three things change:

1. **Connection URL** — You point at `larkdb.net` instead of `firebaseio.com`.
2. **Auth configuration** — If you use Firebase Auth, you tell Lark your Firebase project ID so it can validate tokens.
3. **A few edge cases** — Documented in the [compatibility notes](/firebase/compatibility).

Everything else stays the same. Your code, your security rules, your data model — all unchanged.
