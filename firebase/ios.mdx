Point your Firebase Apple SDK at Lark by passing your Lark URL to `Database.database(url:)`. Everything else — observers, writes, queries — works without changes.

## Setup

Add Firebase Realtime Database via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods:

<CodeGroup>
```swift Swift Package Manager
// In Xcode: File > Add Package Dependencies
// Enter: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
// Select "FirebaseDatabase"
```

```ruby CocoaPods
pod 'Firebase/Database'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connect to Lark

Pass your Lark URL when getting the database instance:

```swift
import FirebaseDatabase

// Change this from https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com
let database = Database.database(url: "https://your-lark-project-id.larkdb.net")
let ref = database.reference()
```

If your `GoogleService-Info.plist` already has the `DATABASE_URL` field, you can update it there instead and use `Database.database()` without arguments.

## Project settings

Before connecting, make sure your Lark project is configured correctly:

1. **Allow Legacy Firebase** must be enabled in your Lark project settings. This turns on the Firebase wire protocol.
2. If your Firebase app stores many independent data silos under path prefixes (game rooms, workspaces, etc.), see [Database routing](/firebase/database-routing) for options on splitting them into separate Lark databases.
