# Authentication

Lark supports anonymous and token-based authentication. You choose how to authenticate when you connect, and you can change authentication state after connecting.

## Anonymous authentication

The simplest option. Connect without any user identity:

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase } from "@lark-sh/client";

const db = new LarkDatabase("my-project/my-database", { anonymous: true });
```

Anonymous connections are not assigned a UID and auth will be `null` for any security rules checks. You can still choose to let anonymous users read or modify data in your app by setting your security rules appropriately.

## Token-based authentication

For identified users, pass a JWT when creating the instance:

```typescript
const db = new LarkDatabase("my-project/my-database", {
  token: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
});
```

The token contains the user's identity (UID, provider, custom claims) and is validated by the Lark server. Your security rules can then reference `auth.uid`, `auth.provider`, and any custom claims.

<Tip>
See the [platform authentication docs](/platform/auth) for details on how to generate JWTs for your users.
</Tip>

## Changing auth state after connecting

You don't have to authenticate at connect time. You can sign in or out at any point after connecting.

### `db.signIn(token)`

Authenticate with a new token. If you were previously anonymous or signed in as a different user, the auth state updates:

```typescript
// Start anonymous
const db = new LarkDatabase("my-project/my-database", { anonymous: true });
await db.connect();

// Later, sign in with a token
await db.signIn("eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...");
```

### `db.signOut()`

Reverts to anonymous authentication:

```typescript
await db.signOut();
```

<Note>
After calling `signOut()`, the connection stays open. You're still connected, just without user identity. Any subscriptions that depend on authenticated access (via security rules) may stop receiving updates.
</Note>

## The `auth` property

Access the current authentication state at any time:

```typescript
// When signed in
console.log(db.auth);
// { uid: "user-123", provider: "custom", token: "eyJ..." }

// When anonymous
console.log(db.auth);
// null
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `uid` | `string` | The user's unique identifier. |
| `provider` | `string` | The authentication provider (e.g., `"custom"`, `"google"`). |
| `token` | `string` | The raw JWT. |

## Listening for auth changes

Use `db.onAuthStateChanged(callback)` to react to sign-in and sign-out events:

```typescript
const unsubscribe = db.onAuthStateChanged((auth) => {
  if (auth) {
    console.log("Signed in as:", auth.uid);
  } else {
    console.log("Signed out (anonymous)");
  }
});

// Stop listening
unsubscribe();
```

The callback fires immediately with the current auth state, then again whenever it changes.

## Full example

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase } from "@lark-sh/client";

const db = new LarkDatabase("my-project/my-database", { anonymous: true });

// Listen for auth state changes
db.onAuthStateChanged((auth) => {
  if (auth) {
    console.log(`Welcome, ${auth.uid}`);
    loadUserData(auth.uid);
  } else {
    console.log("Not authenticated");
    showLoginScreen();
  }
});

// When the user logs in through your app's UI
async function handleLogin(token: string) {
  await db.signIn(token);
  // onAuthStateChanged fires with the new auth state
}

// When the user logs out
async function handleLogout() {
  await db.signOut();
  // onAuthStateChanged fires with null
}
```
