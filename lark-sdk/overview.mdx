# Lark SDK

The Lark SDK (`@lark-sh/client`) is the official JavaScript/TypeScript client for Lark databases. It gives you real-time data synchronization, offline support, and a modern developer experience in a lightweight package.

## Why the Lark SDK?

**Small footprint.** The entire SDK is ~20KB gzipped. No bloated dependency trees. It loads fast and stays out of your way.

**Modern API design.** Subscriptions return an unsubscribe function directly — no need to track callbacks or call a separate `off()` method. This plays nicely with React's `useEffect` cleanup, Vue's `onUnmounted`, and any other framework lifecycle pattern.

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase } from "@lark-sh/client";

const db = new LarkDatabase("my-project/my-database", { anonymous: true });

// on() returns an unsubscribe function — no need to await connect() first
const unsubscribe = db.ref("scores").on("value", (snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.val());
});

// Clean up when you're done
unsubscribe();
```

**First-class WebTransport support.** The SDK automatically negotiates the best transport available. When WebTransport (HTTP/3) is supported, you get lower latency and better multiplexing. It falls back to WebSocket seamlessly.

**Volatile path support.** Ephemeral data like cursor positions, typing indicators, and player coordinates can flow through volatile paths — high-frequency updates that skip persistence for maximum speed.

**Full TypeScript types.** Every method, option, and return value is fully typed. You get autocompletion and compile-time safety without installing separate type packages.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lark-sh/client
```

Or with your preferred package manager:

```bash
yarn add @lark-sh/client
pnpm add @lark-sh/client
```

## Platform support

The Lark SDK works in **browsers** and **Node.js**. Both CommonJS and ESM builds are included — your bundler or runtime will pick the right one automatically.

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) | Full support |
| Node.js 18+ | Full support |
| React Native | Full support |
| Deno | ESM import |

## Package

Everything you need is in a single package:

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase, ServerValue } from "@lark-sh/client";
```

<Tip>
If you're migrating from Firebase v8, the SDK also ships a compatibility layer at `@lark-sh/client/fb-v8`. See the [Firebase v8 compatibility page](/lark-sdk/fb-v8) for details.
