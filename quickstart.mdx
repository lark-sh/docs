## 1. Create a project

Head to the [Lark dashboard](https://dashboard.lark.sh) and sign in with Google. Click **New Project** and give it a name — this generates a project ID you'll use to connect.

In your project's **Settings** page, note your **Project ID**. You'll need it in the next step.

<Tip>Enable **Auto Create** in your project settings so databases are created automatically when a client connects. This is the fastest way to get started.</Tip>

## 2. Pick your SDK

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lark JS SDK" icon="bolt" href="/lark-sdk/quickstart">
    The native TypeScript SDK. Lightweight (~20KB), WebTransport support, volatile paths, modern API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Firebase SDKs" icon="fire" href="/firebase/overview">
    Already using Firebase? Change one URL and your existing code works with Lark. Supports JS, Android, iOS, Flutter, C++, and Unity.

## 3. A quick example with the Lark SDK

If you're starting fresh, here's what it looks like end-to-end:

### Install

```bash
npm install @lark-sh/client
```

### Connect and write data

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase } from '@lark-sh/client';

// Connect to your project and database
const db = new LarkDatabase('your-project-id/my-first-database', {
  anonymous: true
});
await db.connect();

// Write some data
await db.ref('players/alice').set({
  name: 'Alice',
  score: 0
});
```

The `anonymous: true` option connects without authentication — useful for getting started quickly. You'll add proper auth later.

### Read data

```typescript
const snapshot = await db.ref('players/alice').once('value');
console.log(snapshot.val()); // { name: 'Alice', score: 0 }
```

### Subscribe to real-time updates

This is where it gets interesting. Subscribe to a path and your callback fires every time the data changes — from any connected client.

```typescript
const unsubscribe = db.ref('players').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log('Players:', snapshot.val());
});

// Update a score — every subscriber sees it instantly
await db.ref('players/alice/score').set(42);

// When you're done listening
unsubscribe();
```

### Clean up

```typescript
await db.disconnect();
```
