Pricing details are coming soon. Lark is currently in early alpha. During this period, usage is free.

## How Lark pricing works

Lark's pricing is based on **peak concurrent users (CCU)** and **bandwidth** — not per-operation. You can build interactive, high-frequency features without worrying about per-read or per-write costs.
