Your project dashboard shows real-time metrics and usage data so you can keep tabs on how your project is performing.

## Statistics cards

These cards show a snapshot of the last 24 hours:

- **Peak CCU**: Peak and current concurrent users.
- **Bandwidth**: Total bytes in and out, with a breakdown.
- **Operations**: Total writes, reads, and events sent.
- **Processing**: Average latency in milliseconds.

## Charts

Interactive line charts let you drill into trends. Use the time range selector to switch between **1 hour**, **24 hours**, and **7 days**.

Available charts:

- **CCU over time**
- **Bandwidth** (bytes in and out)
- **Operations** (writes, reads, events)
- **Latency** (p50)

## Events log

A log of recent system events from the last 7 days. You will see entries like:

- High latency warnings
- Connection rejected (at capacity)
- Storage warnings
