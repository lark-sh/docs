Your project dashboard shows real-time metrics and usage data so you can keep tabs on how your project is performing.

## Statistics cards

These cards show a snapshot of the last 24 hours:

- **Peak CCU**: Peak and current concurrent users.
- **Bandwidth**: Total bytes in and out, with a breakdown.
- **Operations**: Total writes, reads, and events sent.
- **Processing**: Average latency in milliseconds.

## Charts

Interactive line charts let you drill into trends. Use the time range selector to switch between **1 hour**, **24 hours**, and **7 days**.

Available charts:

- **CCU over time**
- **Bandwidth** (bytes in and out)
- **Operations** (writes, reads, events)
- **Latency** (p50)

## Billing usage

This section shows your current billing period's usage against your plan limits:

- **Peak CCU** vs. your plan limit (default 5,000)
- **Total bandwidth** vs. your plan limit (default 50GB)

Usage is color-coded so you can spot issues at a glance:

- **Green**: Normal usage.
- **Yellow**: 80% or more of your limit.
- **Red**: 95% or more of your limit.

## Events log

A log of recent system events from the last 7 days. You will see entries like:

- High latency warnings
- Approaching CCU limit
- Connection rejected (at capacity)
- Storage warnings

<Note>If you see repeated "connection rejected" events, you are hitting your CCU limit. Consider upgrading your plan or optimizing your connection patterns.</Note>
