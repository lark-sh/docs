The **Databases** section on your project dashboard lists all databases in your project.

## Listing databases

Each database shows its ID, status (active or inactive), server ID, and last activity timestamp. Use the search box to filter by database ID. Results paginate at 100 per page.

## Creating a database

Click **New Database** and enter an ID. Database IDs must be alphanumeric and no longer than 40 characters.

<Tip>Enable **Auto Create** in your [project settings](/dashboard/settings) to create databases automatically on first client connection. This is the easiest way to get started.</Tip>

## Deleting a database

Click the delete button next to any database. This is permanent — all data in that database is removed immediately.

## The data editor

Click any database ID to open the real-time JSON editor. This gives you a live view of the data in your database.

### Tree view

Used for smaller datasets. You get an interactive JSON tree where you can:

- Expand and collapse nodes
- Click any value to edit it inline
- Add new properties
- Delete nodes

Changes are highlighted in amber and save immediately.

### Shallow view

Automatically used for large datasets (more than 500 keys or 20MB). This shows a flat key list with search and sort. Click any key to navigate deeper into the tree.

### Navigation

A breadcrumb trail at the top shows your current path. Click any segment to navigate back up.

### Connection status

A badge in the editor shows whether you are connected to the live database.

## Import and export

You can move data in and out of any database path.

- **Export**: Downloads the data at your current path as a `.json` file. Supports exports up to 256MB.
- **Import**: Upload a `.json` file to replace data at the current path. Supports imports up to 256MB.

<Note>Import replaces all data at the current path. It does not merge with existing data.</Note>
