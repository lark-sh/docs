The Lark dashboard is where you manage everything. Projects, databases, security rules, monitoring — it all lives at [dashboard.lark.sh](https://dashboard.lark.sh).

## Signing in

Sign in with Google OAuth at [dashboard.lark.sh](https://dashboard.lark.sh). Once authenticated, you land on your projects list.

## Projects list

After signing in, you see all your projects. Each project shows:

- **Project name**
- **Project ID**
- **Database count** (total and active)
- **Creation date**

## Creating a project

Click the **New Project** button to get started. Enter a name (max 20 characters), and Lark automatically generates a DNS-compatible project ID.

This project ID is what you use in your SDK connection string to connect clients to your project.

<Tip>Choose a clear, descriptive project name. You can change it later, but the project ID is permanent.</Tip>
