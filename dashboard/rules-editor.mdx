Security rules are edited in your project's **Settings** page, in the right-hand panel.

## Writing rules

The editor supports JSON5 syntax — comments, trailing commas, and unquoted keys are all valid.

Write your rules, then click **Save Rules**. The dashboard validates your rules before saving. If there is a syntax error, you will see it immediately.

Rules take effect as soon as they are saved. There is no separate deploy step.

<Tip>Start with permissive rules while developing, then tighten them before going to production.</Tip>

## Example

Here is a basic rule set that allows anyone to read player data, but only lets players write their own data:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "players": {
      "$playerId": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth.uid === $playerId"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
