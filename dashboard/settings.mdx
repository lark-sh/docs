Access your project settings by clicking **Settings** from your project dashboard.

## Project name

Your display name. You can edit it anytime — it has no effect on connections or configuration.

## Project ID

Read-only after creation. This is the identifier used in SDK connection strings. Click the copy button next to it to grab it.

## Ephemeral mode

When enabled, databases are automatically deleted when no active connections are detected. This is useful for temporary game sessions, testing environments, or any scenario where data doesn't need to persist.

## Auto Create

When enabled, databases are created automatically the first time a client connects. When disabled, databases must be created manually in the dashboard before clients can connect.

<Tip>Keep **Auto Create** enabled while getting started. It removes friction during development.</Tip>

## Allow Legacy Firebase

Enables compatibility with existing Firebase Realtime Database SDKs. When you toggle this on, two additional options appear:

- **Use First Path as Database**: Routes clients by their first path segment. For example, a write to `/room-123/players/alice` goes to a database named `room-123` at path `/players/alice`. See [Database routing](/firebase/database-routing) for when and why to use this.
- **Firebase Auth Project ID**: Your Firebase project ID, used to validate Firebase Auth tokens. Set this if your users authenticate through Firebase Auth.

## Secret key

Your secret key is used to sign Lark authentication tokens (HS256 JWTs). From this section you can view, copy, and regenerate your key.

<Warning>Keep your secret key on your server. Never expose it in client-side code. Regenerating your secret key invalidates all existing tokens immediately.</Warning>

## Danger zone

Delete the project permanently. You must type the project ID to confirm. This action cannot be undone.
