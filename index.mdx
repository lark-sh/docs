Lark is a real-time database designed for the modern era. You write data, your users see it instantly — across every connected client, in under 50 milliseconds.

If you've ever used Firebase Realtime Database, Lark will feel familiar. But Lark is built from the ground up in Rust, with the performance and features that today's multiplayer games and collaborative apps demand.

## Why Lark?

  <Card title="Real-time by default" icon="bolt">
    Every write is broadcast to every subscriber in real time. No polling, no manual refresh. Your UI stays in sync automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built for speed" icon="gauge-max">
    Sub-50ms p99 latency, powered by a Rust engine with a thread-per-core architecture. No garbage collector pauses, no surprises.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tiny client" icon="feather">
    The Lark JS SDK is ~20KB gzipped. Install it, connect, and start building — no heavyweight framework required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WebTransport ready" icon="wifi">
    First-class WebTransport support for UDP-like unreliable delivery. Perfect for cursor positions, player movement, and other high-frequency data.

    Already using Firebase Realtime Database? Point your existing Firebase SDK at Lark and it just works. Change one URL.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security rules" icon="shield-halved">
    Declarative, path-based security rules that run on the server. Control who can read and write what, with full access to auth context and existing data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How it works

Lark stores your data as a JSON tree. You read and write to paths in that tree, and Lark handles synchronization across all connected clients.

```typescript
import { LarkDatabase } from '@lark-sh/client';

const db = new LarkDatabase('my-project/my-database', { anonymous: true });
await db.connect();

// Write data
await db.ref('players/alice').set({ name: 'Alice', score: 0 });

// Subscribe to real-time updates
db.ref('players').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log('Players updated:', snapshot.val());
});

// Every connected client sees the change instantly
await db.ref('players/alice/score').set(42);
```

That's it. No REST endpoints to build, no WebSocket plumbing to manage, no cache invalidation to think about.
