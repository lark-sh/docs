# Lark CLI

The Lark CLI (`@lark-sh/cli`) gives you full control over your projects, databases, security rules, and data from the terminal. Anything you can do in the dashboard, you can do from the command line — plus data operations like export, import, and real-time streaming.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @lark-sh/cli
```

Or run commands directly without installing:

```bash
npx @lark-sh/cli <command>
```

## Getting started

### Log in

```bash
lark login
```

This opens your browser to the Lark dashboard. Authorize the CLI, and you're in. Your session is stored in `~/.lark/config.json`.

### Set a default project

Most commands need a project ID. Set a default so you don't have to pass `--project` every time:

```bash
lark config set-project my-project
```

You can always override it per-command with `--project <id>`.

## Common workflows

### Create a project and database

```bash
# Create a new project
lark projects create "My Game"
# Created project: my-game

# Set it as default
lark config set-project my-game

# Create a database
lark db create game-state
```

### Read and write data

```bash
# Write data
lark data set game-state /players/alice '{"name": "Alice", "score": 0}'

# Read it back
lark data get game-state /players/alice
# {"name": "Alice", "score": 0}

# Update a single field (shallow merge)
lark data update game-state /players/alice '{"score": 42}'

# Push to a list with an auto-generated key
lark data push game-state /messages '{"text": "Hello!", "sender": "alice"}'
# -Nabc123def

# Delete data
lark data delete game-state /players/alice
```

### Pipe data from stdin

Use `-` as the value to read from stdin — useful for large payloads or scripting:

```bash
cat player-data.json | lark data set game-state /players -

echo '{"score": 99}' | lark data update game-state /players/alice -
```

### Watch for real-time changes

Stream live changes to your terminal:

```bash
lark data watch game-state /players
```

Events print as they happen:

```
[put] {"path":"/","data":{"alice":{"name":"Alice","score":42}}}
[patch] {"path":"/alice/score","data":99}
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Export and import data

```bash
# Export a database to a file
lark data export game-state -o backup.json

# Export a specific path
lark data export game-state /players -o players.json

# Import data from a file
lark data import game-state -f backup.json

# Import to a specific path
lark data import game-state /players -f players.json
```

### Manage security rules

```bash
# View current rules
lark rules get

# Set rules from a file (JSON5 supported)
lark rules set -f rules.json

# Or pipe them in
cat rules.json | lark rules set
```

### Check metrics

```bash
# Show dashboard with current metrics
lark dashboard

# View recent events
lark events

# Check billing for a specific month
lark billing --period 2026-02
```

## JSON output for scripting

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
# Get project details as JSON
lark projects show --json

# List databases as JSON
lark db list --json

# Use with jq
lark data get game-state /players --json | jq '.alice.score'
```
