Lark exposes a REST API for reading and writing data over plain HTTP. If you're working from a server, a script, a CLI tool, or any environment where you don't want to maintain a persistent connection, the REST API is the way to go.

## URL format

Every REST request targets a path in your database, with `.json` appended:

```
https://{projectId}.larkdb.net/{database}/{path}.json
```

For example, to access `/players/alice` in the `my-game` database of project `chess-app`:

```
https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players/alice.json
```

The root of a database:

```
https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/.json
```

### Database-in-subdomain format

You can also specify the database as part of the subdomain using `--`:

```
https://{database}--{projectId}.larkdb.net/{path}.json
```

```
https://my-game--chess-app.larkdb.net/players/alice.json
```

## Authentication

Pass an auth token as a query parameter:

```
GET https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN
```

The `auth` parameter accepts any token that Lark supports — [Lark tokens](/platform/authentication) (HS256 JWTs signed with your secret key) or [Firebase Auth tokens](/firebase/auth).

You can also use `access_token` as an alias:

```
GET https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players.json?access_token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

If you omit the token, the request is treated as anonymous. Your [security rules](/platform/security-rules) determine what anonymous clients can access.

## Operations at a glance

| HTTP method | Operation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | Read | Fetch data at a path |
| `PUT` | Set | Replace data at a path |
| `POST` | Push | Add a child with an auto-generated key |
| `PATCH` | Update | Merge data at a path |
| `DELETE` | Remove | Delete data at a path |

## When to use the REST API

- **Server-side operations** — Read or write data from your backend without maintaining a WebSocket connection.
- **One-off scripts** — Import data, seed a database, or run migrations.
- **Webhooks and integrations** — Receive a webhook, write to Lark with a single HTTP call.
- **Environments without WebSocket support** — Edge functions, serverless workers, or constrained runtimes.
- **Debugging** — Quick reads with `curl` to inspect your data.

For real-time subscriptions and persistent connections, use the [Lark SDK](/lark-sdk/overview) or [Firebase SDKs](/firebase/overview) instead.

## Quick example

```bash
# Write data
curl -X PUT \
  'https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players/alice.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "score": 0}'

# Read it back
curl 'https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players/alice.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN'
# {"name":"Alice","score":0}

# Update a single field
curl -X PATCH \
  'https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players/alice.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"score": 42}'

# Push a new child with auto-generated key
curl -X POST \
  'https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/messages.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"text": "Hello!", "sender": "alice"}'
# {"name":"-Kabc123xyz"}

# Delete data
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://chess-app.larkdb.net/my-game/players/alice.json?auth=YOUR_TOKEN'
```
